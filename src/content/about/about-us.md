Revived. is an impersonal and colorless brand that shows the colors and personality of the creators. We keep our creators content safe, under righteous copyright, promote and share their work in a way that only they will benefit from it. Our main target is creators that have had massive potential in any kind of creative work for years without promotional success.

That includes: Music, Editing, Filming, Sound design, Photography, Drawing, Art, Gaming content and Game development. We also bring those creators together to make creations such as Music videos, Lyric videos, Edits and Mini-movies. This brand was founded by Nino Rivera and Jol3x in 2022.
At the core of Revived. is a belief in the power of creativity and the impact it can have on people's lives. It serves as a reminder that every creator has the potential to make a difference, to inspire others and to leave a lasting legacy.

Beyond just promoting and sharing their work, Revived. is dedicated to supporting and uplifting its creators. It is a safe haven where creativity can flourish, where the imagination knows no bounds, and where the only limit is one's own ambition.

Revived. is more than just a brand, it is a movement , a celebration of the human spirit and its boundless potential. By empowering its creators and providing them with the resources they need to succeed, Revived. is making a difference in the world, one creative endeavor at a time.
